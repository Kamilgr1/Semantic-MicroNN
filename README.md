# Semantic-MicroNN
Proof-of-concept for solving catastrophic forgetting and achieving zero-shot compositionality in micro-NNs. PhaseVortex uses subliminal white noise for data-free continual learning and orthogonal phase keys to decouple syntax from semantics. It forms true cognitive abstractions without storing old datasets or relying on massive compute scale.
